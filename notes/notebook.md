# Notebook

This is my wall of sticky notes where literally anything that I find interesting gets put. Info here may extremely tangential to the actual project.

## Background Stuff

Computer + Music seemed to arise around 1960 (the early 60s) - Wiki and Byrd

Donald Byrd at Indiana U
Music Informatics Group at IU

A lot of early research (60s and 70s) in music/computer seems to have happened at IU
+ [Jerome Wenker's MUSTRAN](https://wiki.ccarh.org/wiki/Mustran)

Terminology:
+ Formalizing rules for non-piano reduction

## Fourier

"Learn the fourier transform inside and out" -reddit guy on doing anything in music tech industry

Fourier:
+ Concerned heat transfer and vibrations:
  + Fourier analysis: representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer
  + Harmonic analysis: a branch of mathematics concerned with investigating the connections between a function and its representation in frequency.
+ Fourier transform:
  + An integral transform that takes a function as input and outputs another function that describes the extent to which various frequencies are present in the original function.
+ A Fourier series: an expansion of a periodic function into a sum of trigonometric functions. 
+ Also credited with figuring out the greenhouse effect
